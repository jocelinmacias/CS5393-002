Project#3 for CS5393-002

My goal is to practice using Git and GitHub by programming a sentiment analysis tool to determine whether the sentiment of a tweet is positive or negative. We define a custom string type called DSString and implement a DSString class, handling memory allocation and management using the rule of three.

The sentiment analysis process includes a training phase and a testing phase. In the training phase, the sentiment value of a word is determined by its frequency in positive or negative tweets. In the testing phase, I compare the list of positive and negative words generated during training with a reference dataset that contains the correct sentiment classifications. Finally, I calculated the accuracy of the sentiment analysis by dividing the number of correctly classified tweets by the total number of tweets in the test dataset.
